#PDF and Excel creator with PHP

I' ve developed a small script to create a JSON file and store in it data collected in a form..
Using the button Create PDF data from this file will be converted to PDF format as well as with the button Create Excel the JSON file is formatted to EXCEL.
It is important to note that the function will create a JSON file if it doesn't exist and if the file already exist, the function will rewrite it adding the new data at the end.
